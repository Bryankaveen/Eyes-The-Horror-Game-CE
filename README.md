Eyes: The Horror Game is a first-person horror game in which your objective is very simple: you have to enter a building in the middle of the night, find around 20 bags full of money, and escape before anyone realizes what you've done.

The problem is that you won't have to escape from security guards or cameras, but rather from ghosts. The kind of ghosts that kill everything they are faced to.

You'll have to explore every corner of the building to collect the bags of money while being careful not to get spotted by paranormal presences. If you notice that the furniture starts to shake, or if you start to hear strange sounds, know that it's time to run away or else you'll have to face horrible creatures, which will lead to your certain death.

You will see the eyes drawn on the walls of some rooms. By touching these drawings you will see scary images of different places inside the building.
